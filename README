Stick (Spiro's Tick) is a TIC file processor for Linux Bulletin Boards. 

It is as dumb as a stick. 

---=[ How dumb is it? ]=---

Stick looks for *.tic files in your specified Inbound directory, moves the 
associated file to the relevant file directory, and that's it.

It's up to you to import the files into your BBS's file bases, most likely by
running its mass upload feature.

Stick is also too dumb to deal with descriptions. Most files will come in
as archives with file_id.diz files anyway, so your BBS should deal with that.

If Stick exists with an errorlevel of 2, then it has processed some TIC files
and you can run your importer.

eg; a simple bash script to import your files into Mystic might look like:

#!/bin/bash
stick -c /mbbs/stick.cfg
if [ $? == 2 ]; then
	/mbbs/mutil /mbbs/fileimport.ini
fi

Stick that in a cron job and Bob's your uncle.


---=[ Config File ]=---

By default, stick will look in the current directory for a file called
'stick.cfg'. This can be over-ridden on the commandline with the 
-c argument.

The config file should have at least the INBOUND directory defined, and at
least one AREANAME line. Everything else is optional.

Options:
--------

INBOUND <inbound file echo directory>
AREANAME <file echo name> <BBS destination directory>
LOGFILE <logfile>
DEBUG <[yes/no]|[1/0]|[on/off]>
ANNOUNCE <filename>


INBOUND     : this takes one parameter -- the incoming path that your mailer
              deposits files into.
AREANAME    : The first parameter is the network's file echo name;
              eg; Agora's BBS Mods echo is called AGN_MODS
              The second parameter is the path you want the files for that
              echo deposited into.
LOGFILE     : The full path to your log file. If this is not specified, Stick
              will default to 'stick.log' in the current directory.
DEBUG       : This turns on debugging, which puts more info in the log file,
              such as the full source and destination paths of files being
              imported.
ANNOUNCE    : A filename to announce imports. This can then be imported into
              a message board so your users know.

Anything that's not a path-/file-name is case insensitive.

Comments can be added by making the first character of each line a 
semi-colon (;) or a hash (#). 


============================================

Things I'd like to add, but may not unless people ask nicely:

 - Checking if the destination file already exists, and comparing that to
   the TIC's Replace line.
 - Adding a PostExec line in the cfg file to run if it hits that magical
   errorlevel 2. However, this will take it one step closer to sentience.
 - Feeding the descriptions to your postprocessor.
